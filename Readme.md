Hello Everyone I have worked on this project to learn more about digital Image Processing as I had an elective in my college but what they taught us I didn't understand a thing which made it more hard to learn 
Now here I am learning on youtube google GPT to learn what I should have learnt in the class where I paid fees for

This is a basic project but a great start I f you are looking for learning juat like me.

# Color Detection using OpenCV

Welcome to the Color Detection repository! This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to detect specific colors in images and video streams. It's a great starting point for computer vision projects involving color-based object tracking, filtering, and more.

## Introduction

Color detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that can be applied to various applications such as object tracking, image segmentation, and robotics. This repository provides a simple and effective method to detect and highlight specific colors using OpenCV.

## Features

- **Real-time color detection**: Process live video streams to detect colors.
- **Image color detection**: Detect colors in static images.
- **Adjustable color ranges**: Easily modify the range of colors to detect by adjusting the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) thresholds.
- **Highlight detected colors**: Highlight and display the detected colors on the processed image or video.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-detection-opencv.git
   cd color-detection-opencv
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Color Detection on Images

To detect colors in an image, use the following command:
```bash
python detect_color_image.py --image path_to_image --lower lower_H,lower_S,lower_V --upper upper_H,upper_S,upper_V
```
Example:
```bash
python detect_color_image.py --image samples/image.jpg --lower 35,100,100 --upper 85,255,255
```

### Running Color Detection on Video

To detect colors in a video stream (e.g., from a webcam), use the following command:
```bash
python detect_color_video.py --lower lower_H,lower_S,lower_V --upper upper_H,upper_S,upper_V
```
Example:
```bash
python detect_color_video.py --lower 35,100,100 --upper 85,255,255
```
